# matlab_Benchmarks
Real world use case benchmarks for a very specific niche of industry.

# Results


## Motivation

After doing some [``profiling``](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/profile.html) of my daily workflow I discovered that my [Laptop](http://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-zbook-studio-g3-mobile-workstation-(energy-star\)) was faster than my [Desktop](http://store.hp.com/us/en/mdp/business-solutions/z840-workstation), despite a large disparity in specifications.

Specifications and benchmarks don't give an indication of how a system will affect my workflow.
